# Food Made Simple Support
Food Made Simple is a collection of the recipes from the cookbooks that share the same name. Version 1 of this app is designed for information: to allow users to see and access all information relevant to each recipe. Future versions are planned to introduce expanded interaction and functionality within the app, such as expanded filtering options and the ability to mark recipes as favorites.
